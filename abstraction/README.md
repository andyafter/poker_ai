Poker Abstraction

The abstraction according to my understanding is the most important part of the artificial intelligence. 

The method for game abstraction will define how the AI will act in certain positions with certain information. For example, Pluribus tends to overbet a lot in many scenarios. This is due to the viable choices selected in the abstraction phase. In a word, I as an artificial agent raises 3 times the pot size because it was provided as a viable choice before I was trained.   

We need to perform abstractions on both the actions and cards. Ideally if an agent was calculated with CFR with a full scale game, it would achieve the game theory optimal result. With abstraction, scenarios are grouped together based on their similarity manually or algorithmically. Which may lead to the result where the agent does not perform GTO actions in certain scenarios. However if we want an agent to defeat human players, a full scale GTO is not required.
